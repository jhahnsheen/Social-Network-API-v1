# BKSB Social Network API v1

The BKSB Social Network API (BKSB) is a fully functioning backend to a social network. With the rise of the internet, it is easier than ever to stay connected with your friends and family. BKSB allows you to create, update, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions and then save them all to a database. 

## Installation

As a command-line application, there is no front end and thus it is not deployed anywhere. However, the application can still be run on your personal computer. 

Please note that these instructions will require an [SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) for GitHub, as well as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). A data tester, such as Insomnia, is necessary for the successful use of this application.

1. Follow this [link](https://github.com/jhahnsheen/Social-Network-API-v1) to the repository containing the code.

2. Locate the 'Code' button located under the nav bar and to the immediate left of the 'About' aside. Click and select SSH and copy the clone link.

3. Open your terminal on your computer and navigate to the location where you want to clone the repo. Type in the command 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jhahnsheen/Social-Network-API-v1.git
```

4. Open the cloned git file in your IDE and terminal. 

5. Run the npm installation command
```bash
npm install 
```
6. Run the node start command
```
npm run start
```
7. Open Insomnia and use port 3001 to access the database servers.

## Features

As a backend application, there is not much to see. However, the functionality of being able to add, edit, find, and delete users, thoughts, and reactions is all there and ready to be implemented with a front end. 

## Usage
